                <p class='date'><i>January - March 2019</i></p>
                <p>This was a game that me and 4 others made in 10 weeks for a class. The prompt word was "seasoning", so we came up with a timed minigame where the player has to try to collect as many spices in a busy mall as they can. Each level is procedurally generated, so replaying it is always fresh. I did all of the art assets, making sure that they worked well with the level generator.</p>

            <h2>Animating</h2>
            <p>This was my first time doing art digitally, so I used the free program Krita to experiment with. This was a huge learning experience as I learned about animation. The three animations (run, jump, grab) took about a week and a half to do since I had no base knowledge, but I had a fun time doing it! </p>

            <h2>Character Design</h2>
            <p>Since our prompt was "seasoning", I wanted to find a way to incorporate spices into the character design. We also needed our character to stand out since we knew our game was going to have a lot of visual elements to give the feeling of a busy shopping mall.</p>
