                <p>This game was made in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2020 with 2 friends. The prompt was "repair", and since we started late we decided to make a simple puzzle game that randomly generates puzzles for endless gameplay. I did all of the art once again, and together the three of us came up with Fix it Faucet!</p>

            <h2>Character Design</h2>
            <p>Since there wasn't very much time to experiment with different characters, I gave myself 30 minutes to come up with a character that would be quirky and interesting while not distracting players from the puzzle. I wanted her to be like a cute mascot that almost cheers on players, and I also wanted her to be a plumber to enhance the pipes theme. Originally we wanted to incorporate a plunger into her design as a gag, but when the faucet pigtails were proposed again, we unanimously agreed they were cuter. The character's name is Pipp.</p>

            <h2>Vector Art</h2>
            <p>I had never done much work in vector art before, but when it was time to make an icon for the game, I decided to give it a shot. I used the Vectornator app on the ipad alongside Procreate to sketch and create the finished icon of Pipp.</p>
