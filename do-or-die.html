                <p>Do or Die is my senior Capstone project. We have 20 weeks to make a game under the guidance of our mentors from Blizzard and Amazon Games. I did the art and 3D modeling since our team had no artists, but I also played an active role in the game design. I also did all of the UI testing and aided in playtests.</p>

            <h2>Character Design</h2>
            <p>My general character design workflow was to gather information on the enemy's movement and attack styles, experiement with different animals or shapes, then focus on the clothing and poses. Here was my process for designing a suicide enemy that rushes the player and blows up.</p>

            <h2>UI Testing</h2>
            <p>I have never had to deal with making a game UI layout, so I really wanted to make sure I did it right through extensive testing and readjusting. We didn't have a clear idea what final objects were gonna make it in the game, so I had to make multiple game mockups with different items such as abilities, stats, and health. After we reached a semi-final decision, I made the actual UI elements and went around performing UI tests on people with different levels of experience with games. A total of 12 different layouts were tested. Two weeks before the deadline we decided last minute to add in 3 distinct player classes, 6 unique movement and attack abilities, and 6 types of pickups. Because of this it was a rush to get each icon finished and tested to make sure each ability's effect was clear.</p>
