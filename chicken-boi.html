            <p>Originally a final project for a class in 3D modeling, I am currently still working on redoing it to make it more polished and visually appealing. This was my first time doing any sort of 3D modeling, and while Maya was initially very intimidating, I think I'd like to continue experimenting with it. Look forward to seeing it finished!</p>

            <p>Since Maya was a new thing to me, it took a while to get used to the controls and all of the different tools. However, I started getting the hang of it the more simple shapes and objects I made. Once I felt confident, I moved on to making Chicken Boy, the main character of the game. I wanted him to actually believe that he was a chicken trying to free his family, so I tried to reflect that in his design.</p>
