            <p>April - June 2020, October - present<br><br> Originally am old final project for a class in 3D modeling, I'm currently working on completely redoing it to make it more polished and visually appealing. This was my first time doing any sort of 3D modeling, and my meshes reflected that. I also spent all my time focusing on the modeling instead of animating and making it into an actual game, so now I'm hoping to remake it with all the new things I've learned. Look forward to seeing it finished!</p>

            <h2>Design</h2>
            <p>The main character is, of course, Chicken Boy. I wanted him to actually believe that he was a chicken trying to free his family, so I tried to reflect that in his design. I didn't realize it at the time, but modeling his cape would be a totally new adventure for me. The world itself was not as planned out as the character though. Other than the basic layout (loft, basement, etc.), I just made a list of items I wanted to model in the world, then scattered them in a way that looked nice and made sense with me. I started with big items, like the horse pen and loft, then filled in empty space with various smaller tools.<p>

            <h2>Modeling</h2>
            <p>The next step was to take these plans and add 1 more dimension! While the original project was in Maya, by the time I decided I wanted to redo it my student license expired. I ended up having to learn Blender, but I'm glad I did! The transition wasn't very hard, and there were a lot of online resources to help me along the way. I'm still in this stage since there's lots of small things I want to make to fill out the world, and I'm having a lot of fun learning more about modeling in Blender.</p>
