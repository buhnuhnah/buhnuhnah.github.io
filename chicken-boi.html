                <p class='date'><i>April - July 2021<br>(Currently on haitus)</i></p>
                 <p>Originally an old final project for a class in 3D modeling, I'm currently working on completely redoing it to make it more polished and visually appealing. This was my first time doing any sort of 3D modeling, and my meshes reflected that. Now I'm hoping to remake it and learn a bit about solo dev work, but I'm currently taking a break on this to work on other projects. Look forward to seeing it finished!</p>

            <h2>Character Design</h2>
            <p>The main character is, of course, Chicken Boy. I wanted him to actually believe that he was a chicken trying to free his family, so I tried to reflect that in his design. I didn't realize it at the time, but modeling his cape would be a totally new adventure for me. I really enjoyed working on him in Maya, so his design hasn't changed yet (still holding out for when I start modeling him in blender).<p>

            <h2>Environment Design</h2>
            <p>The world itself was not as planned out as the character in the first round. Other than the basic layout (loft, basement, etc.), I just made a list of items I wanted to model in the world, then scattered them in a way that made sense with me. When remaking it in Blender, I tried planning out the world on paper first to save a lot of modeling time. I started with large shapes, like the loft and horse pen, then filled in empty space with small objects.</p>

            <h2>Modeling</h2>
            <p>The next step was to take these plans and add 1 more dimension! While the original project was in Maya, by the time I decided I wanted to redo it my student license expired. I ended up having to learn Blender, but I'm glad I did! The transition wasn't very hard, and there were a lot of online resources to help me along the way. I'm still in this stage since there's lots of small things I want to make to fill out the world, and I'm having a lot of fun learning more about modeling in Blender. Hoping to finish two environments soon!</p>
